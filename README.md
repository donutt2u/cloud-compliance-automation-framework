## üöÄ Enterprise Overview
**Cloud Compliance Automation Framework (CCAF)** is an enterprise-grade, modular platform for **continuous compliance-as-code**, automated evidence collection, and **policy-driven remediation** across multi-cloud estates (AWS, Azure, GCP). CCAF translates regulatory and security requirements into **repeatable, auditable pipelines** so organizations can operationalize risk reduction and maintain **audit readiness at scale**.

**Core Objectives**
- Real-time **compliance posture** with proactive drift detection.
- **Audit-ready evidence** mapped to frameworks (ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, CIS, PCI-DSS, GDPR).
- **Shift-left** checks in DevSecOps pipelines with Gates/Approvals.
- Enterprise-grade governance: **RBAC**, secure secret handling, logging, immutable audit trails.

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Guide (Copy-Paste Safe)

> Run initial deployments in **non-production** or isolated accounts. Follow corporate change control.

### 1) Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (virtualenv/venv)
- Non-root IAM / Service Principal with **scoped** permissions
- Terraform ‚â• 1.4 (Ansible optional)
- Docker (optional)
- Prometheus & Grafana (or managed)
- Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault

### 2) Environment Variables & Secrets (example)
    export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
    export CCAF_ENV="production"
    export TF_VAR_admin_email="security@example.com"
    # Secrets are injected at runtime via a secrets manager. Do not hardcode.

### 3) Install Python Dependencies
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4) Bootstrap Orchestration (Phased)
    # Phase 1 ‚Äî Preparation (inventory & credentials)
    ./scripts/prepare_env.sh

    # Phase 2 ‚Äî Deploy Infrastructure (IaC)
    cd infrastructure/terraform
    terraform init
    terraform apply -auto-approve

    # Phase 3 ‚Äî Framework Installation & Services
    ./scripts/install_services.sh

    # Phase 4 ‚Äî Initial Scan & Baseline Report
    python src/cli.py scan --all --output reports/initial_baseline.json

    # Phase 5 ‚Äî Enable Continuous Monitoring
    ./scripts/enable_continuous_mode.sh

### 5) Targeted Scan (Example)
    python src/cli.py scan --resource-type s3 --profile org-audit \
      --output reports/s3_scan_$(date +%F).json

### 6) Dashboards (Default Local)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana:    http://localhost:3000  (default admin/admin ‚Äî change immediately)

## üîó CI/CD Integration (Shift-Left)
- Add a pipeline stage to run policy checks on PRs.
- Enforce gates: **fail** on High/Critical; **ticket** Medium/Low with remediation hints.
- Example GitHub Action job:
    # workflow/ccaf-policy-check.yml
    jobs:
      ccaf-scan:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - run: python src/cli.py ci-check

- Pre-commit hooks for IaC and policy packs:
    pre-commit run --all-files

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Hardening & Operational Guidance
- Start scans with **read-only** credentials; enable remediation via **narrowly-scoped** elevated roles.
- **Separation of duties** between scanning and remediation operators.
- Store all evidence in **immutable** object storage with lifecycle and access logging.
- Enforce **least-privilege** IAM; use **SCPs** (where applicable).
- Maintain **exceptions registry** with expiry, owner, and business justification.
- Sign and timestamp evidence; track provenance and integrity.

---

## üîç Audit Reporting & Evidence
- Reports generated to `reports/` in **JSON, CSV, PDF**.
- Each finding contains:
  - Resource identifiers
  - Evidence snapshot (API response, config diff)
  - Control mapping (framework, control ID)
  - Severity, remediation playbook, suggested owner
- Build final audit bundle:
    python src/cli.py generate-report --id <scan_id>

---

## üìà Observability & Metrics
- Prometheus metrics:
    ccaf_scan_total
    ccaf_finding_count{severity}
    ccaf_remediation_runs_total
- Grafana dashboards:
  - Posture overview
  - Controls-by-status
  - Remediation throughput & MTTR
- Ship logs to SIEM for retention, correlation, and forensics.

---

## üß≠ Compliance Coverage & Mapping (High Level)
- **NIST CSF** ‚Äî Identify / Protect / Detect / Respond / Recover
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** ‚Äî Annex A mappings & evidence templates
- **CIS Benchmarks** ‚Äî Cloud provider recommendations
- **PCI-DSS v4.0** ‚Äî Cardholder data controls in cloud
- **GDPR** ‚Äî Articles 25, 32, 33 (Data Protection by Design & Default)

See `docs/compliance-matrix.md` for full control-to-rule mappings and evidence requirements.

---

## üîí Security, Responsible Disclosure & NDA
**Enterprise disclosure & triage:**
- Report issues to `security@<your-domain>.com` or open a GitHub Issue with the `SECURITY` label.
- **Do not** post PoCs publicly; coordinated disclosure is required.

**MNDA Requirement:**
- For remediation/PoC sharing involving environment access or sensitive artifacts, a **Mutual NDA (MNDA)** is required.
- **Target turnaround: 48 hours**, aligned to typical ISO/NIST incident response SLAs.

**Researchers:**
- Coordinated disclosure **without NDA** is supported per `SECURITY.md`.

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality Gates
    # Unit tests and static analysis
    pytest tests/
    flake8 src/

- CI runs lints, unit tests, and policy checks on every PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Integration tests target **isolated** accounts/emulators (never production).

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Excerpt)
- Multi-account auto-discovery & delegated scanning
- K8s (CIS) policy packs & cluster drift detection
- Evidence notarization and SBOM linkage
- Expanded control libraries (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 42001)
- Fine-grained exception SLAs and attestation workflows

---

## ü§ù Contributing & Governance
- Contributions follow `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- Use GitHub Issues for features/bugs; label security issues as `security`.
- Architectural RFCs live under `design-proposals/`.
