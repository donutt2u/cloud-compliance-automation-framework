## üöÄ Enterprise Overview
**Cloud Compliance Automation Framework (CCAF)** is an enterprise-grade, modular platform for **continuous compliance-as-code**, automated evidence collection, and policy-driven remediation across multi-cloud estates (AWS, Azure, GCP). CCAF codifies security controls and compliance requirements into repeatable, auditable pipelines so organizations can operationalize risk reduction at scale.

Core goals:
- Provide **real-time compliance posture** and drift detection.
- Enable **audit-ready evidence** mapped to controls (ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, CIS, PCI-DSS, GDPR).
- Integrate directly into DevSecOps pipelines for **shift-left** enforcement and automated remediation.
- Support enterprise governance: RBAC, secure secrets handling, logging, and audit trails.

---

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities (Executive Summary)
- **Policy-as-Code Engine**: Modular rules engine with support for custom and framework-aligned rule packs.  
- **Automated Scanning**: Resource inventory + continuous scanning for misconfigurations (IAM, storage, networking, KMS, logging).  
- **Remediation-as-Code**: Safe, idempotent remediation playbooks with approval gating and rollback.  
- **Audit Reporting**: Automated generation of evidence bundles (JSON, CSV, PDF) mapped to regulatory controls.  
- **Observability & Dashboards**: Grafana dashboards with Prometheus metrics for posture, trends, and SLA monitoring.  
- **IaC Integration**: Terraform / CloudFormation / ARM / Pulumi modules & pre-commit checks for IaC security.  
- **Pipeline Integrations**: Native GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins pipelines for policy checks pre-merge.  
- **Operational Runbooks**: Incident playbooks, forensics evidence extraction, and recommended remediation steps.  
- **Security-First Design**: Zero-trust principles, least-privilege defaults, secret handling via vaults.

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Guide
> This section is intentionally presented as a single contiguous set of instructions and examples suitable for copying into a `README.md` or runbook. Follow enterprise change control and run in non-production or isolated environments first.

### 1. Prerequisites (Enterprise baseline)
- Python **3.11+** (use virtualenv / venv)  
- Non-root **IAM user** or service principal with scoped permissions for scanning & remediation. Never use cloud root accounts.  
- **Terraform** (recommended >= 1.4) and **Ansible** (optional)  
- **Docker** (optional) for containerised components  
- Grafana & Prometheus (or managed equivalents) for monitoring and visualisation  
- Vault / Secrets manager for credentials (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault)

### 2. Environment variables & secrets (example)
Set required variables in your CI/CD secret store or runner environment:
    export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
    export CCAF_ENV=" production"
    export TF_VAR_admin_email="security@example.com"
    # Secrets should be injected at runtime from a secret manager; do not hardcode.

### 3. Install Python dependencies
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Bootstrap orchestration (Phased execution)
Phase 1 ‚Äî Preparation (inventory & credentials)
    ./scripts/prepare_env.sh
Phase 2 ‚Äî Deploy Infrastructure (IaC)
    cd infrastructure/terraform
    terraform init
    terraform apply -auto-approve
Phase 3 ‚Äî Framework Installation & Services
    ./scripts/install_services.sh
Phase 4 ‚Äî Initial Scan & Baseline Report
    python src/cli.py scan --all --output reports/initial_baseline.json
Phase 5 ‚Äî Enable Continuous Monitoring
    ./scripts/enable_continuous_mode.sh

### 5. Example: run a targeted scan
    python src/cli.py scan --resource-type s3 --profile org-audit --output reports/s3_scan_$(date +%F).json

### 6. Viewing dashboards (default local)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090  
- Grafana:  http://localhost:3000  *(default admin/admin ‚Äî change immediately)*

### 7. Integrating with CI/CD
- Add a pipeline stage to run policy checks on PRs:
    - Check IaC templates with pre-commit hooks and `ccaf policy check` command.
    - Fail the pipeline for high/critical findings; create tickets for medium/low with automated remediation suggestions.
- Example action: add `workflow/ccaf-policy-check.yml` with a job that executes `python src/cli.py ci-check`.

### 8. Hardening & Operational Guidance
- Run scans using a **read-only** credential first; only enable remediation with an elevated, narrowly-scoped role and approval workflow.
- Maintain separation of duties: scanners vs remediation operators.
- Store all audit evidence in an immutable object store with lifecycle and access logging.
- Enforce least-privilege IAM and use service control policies where available.

---

## üîç Audit Reporting & Evidence
- Reports are generated to `reports/` as structured JSON, CSV, and human-readable PDF summaries.
- Each finding includes:
  - Resource identifier(s)
  - Evidence snapshot (API response, config diff)
  - Control mapping (framework, control ID)
  - Risk rating, remediation playbook, suggested owner
- Use the `src/cli.py generate-report --id <scan_id>` to build the final audit bundle.

---

## üîí Security, Responsible Disclosure & NDA
**Enterprise disclosure & triage policy**
- For vulnerability reports and PoCs, contact `security@<your-domain>.com` or open an issue with `SECURITY` label. Do **not** post PoC publicly.  
- **NDA requirement for engaged remediation/PoC sharing:** For any coordinated remediation work where we must access your environments or share sensitive PoCs, an executed Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (MNDA) is required. **Target turnaround for MNDA execution: 48 hours** from request. This timeframe aligns with incident response SLAs used by many enterprise risk frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST).  
- If you are a security researcher and want coordinated disclosure without an NDA, follow the policy in `SECURITY.md`. We accept responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities and reward meaningful reports per our bug bounty / triage process.

---

## üß™ Testing & CI
- Unit tests and static analysis:
    pytest tests/
    flake8 src/
- CI: GitHub Actions pipeline runs tests, lints, and policy checks for each PR. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Integration tests are executed against isolated test accounts or emulators (do not use production).

---

## üìà Observability & Metrics
- Prometheus metrics exported by the scanner and remediation engine include:
  - `ccaf_scan_total`, `ccaf_finding_count{severity}`, `ccaf_remediation_runs_total`
- Grafana dashboards provide:
  - Posture overview, controls-by-status, remediation throughput, mean-time-to-remediated (MTTR)
- Centralised logs should be shipped to SIEM for long-term retention and forensic workflows.

---

## üîÅ Compliance Coverage & Mapping (high-level)
- **NIST CSF** ‚Äî Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover; mapping available in `docs/compliance-matrix.md`.  
- **ISO/IEC 27001** ‚Äî Annexe A control mappings and evidence templates included.  
- **CIS Benchmarks** ‚Äî Modules for cloud provider CIS recommendations.  
- **PCI-DSS v4.0** ‚Äî Selected cardholder-data relevant controls for cloud deployments.  
- **GDPR** ‚Äî Data Protection by Design & Default (Articles 25, 32, 33) guidance included.

Refer to `docs/` for the full control-to-rule mappings and evidence requirements.

---

## ü§ù Contributing & Governance
- Follow `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.  
- Submit feature requests and issues via GitHub Issues; label changes and security issues as `security`.  
- Use the `design-proposals/` folder for architectural RFCs and major design discussions.
